# cdk-test

This project is part of the presentation I gave at Denver Dev Days on May31st, 2019. In it, I showed why the value of unit testing in IaC can take DevOps to the next level of producivity.

The code contained in the [./src](src/) directory is a CDK module + unit tests that created a simple CICD Pipeline in AWS.

This project is free to fork and submit pull requests on.

Thanks,
M
